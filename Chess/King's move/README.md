Two different squares of a chessboard are given. Write a program that determines whether the king can move from the
first square to the second square in one move. The program receives four numbers from 1 to 8 each, giving the column
number and row number for the first square and then for the second square. The program should output "YES" if the king
can move from the first cell to the second cell, or "NO" otherwise.

### Input data:

Four numbers from 1 to 8.
